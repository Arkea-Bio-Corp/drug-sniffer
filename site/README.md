# Drug Sniffer Website

To update the site, take a look at the files in `source`, they are in .rst
format, take a look at
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html> for
an introduction to this format.

Once you've made your changes, run `build.sh`, which will build the
documentation and also move it to the correct location in the repo.  Then, you
can commit all changes and push (or submit a pull request).
