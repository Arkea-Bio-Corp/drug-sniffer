# Drug Sniffer Website

To update the site, take a look at the files in `source`, they are in .rst
format, see
<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html> for
an introduction to this format.

To build the site, you'll need to have Docker installed. Then, just run
`build.sh` and the script will do the rest. Commit any files that were changed,
and push or submit a pull request.
