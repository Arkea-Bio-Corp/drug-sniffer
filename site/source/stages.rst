Stages
======

The ``workflow/`` directory contains everything necessary to run the Drug Sniffer
pipeline conveniently on a variety of computing platforms.

Container configuration can be found in the ``containers/`` directory. However,
*Drug Sniffer* users should not need to interact with the contents of this
directory.

The individual
components of the pipeline (stages) are described below. Although it is possible
to use the pipeline without understanding the individual stages, this information
is provided here to aid users in troubleshooting, and for completeness.

Docker Images
-------------

Each stage in the Drug Sniffer pipeline has its own Docker image. The images can
be built all at once with the ``build-images.sh`` script found in the ``tool/``
directory, which can be run from the repository root. This script accepts three
parameters as environment variables, listed below. These allow the images to be
built and pushed to registries other than the default locations.

* ``IMAGE_REGISTRY`` - the registry that will host the image, this doesn't
  matter if the image will only be used locally
* ``IMAGE_NAMESPACE`` - the owner of the image, this is usually a project or
  organization name and, again, doesn't matter for images that will never be
  pushed to a registry
* ``IMAGE_VERSION`` - the version identifier to be applied to the image

All of the variables above have usable defaults.

To build the image for a particular stage for testing purposes, run
``build-image.sh`` in the directory corresponding to that stage. To run the
container, for manual debugging, use ``run-image.sh``. To run the automated
smoke tests, use ``test-image.sh``. The tests rely on data files stored in the
``test/`` directory and may write additional outputs to that same location
when they run.

The diagram above illustrates how data flows through the *Drug Sniffer*
pipeline. For the most part, users will not need to concern themselves with
this.

Running a Stage
---------------

Within each Docker image is a script, included in the :code:`PATH`, called
`run.sh`. This script serves as the API for the container. To run a stage, the
user sets certain environment variables and then executes the script. All stages
work this way. Required and optional environment variables are described along
with each stage below.

Stage 1 - Target Identification
--------------------------------

The user is presumed to have chosen a target protein. For example, the
SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Protein.

Stage 2 - Pocket Prediction
---------------------------

Pocket prediction is a manual process. Once a pocket has been selected, it is
provided to the *Drug Sniffer* pipeline as a PDB file along with information
about the pocket geometry. See :ref:`parameters` for details.

Some common pocket prediction tools include `ProBis <http://probis.cmm.ki.si>`_,
`FTMAP <http://ftmap.bu.edu>`_, and
`POCASA <https://g6altair.sci.hokudai.ac.jp/g6/service/pocasa/manual.html>`_.

Stage 3 - Denovo Molecule Design
--------------------------------

One option for identifying leads is to dock a virtual library of pre-enumerated
compounds. Alternatively, one may evolve drug-like molecules using a genetic
algorithm.

In *Drug Sniffer*, we make use of AutoGrow4, an open-source program that
uses an evolutionary algorithm to generate novel leads from a set of chemically
diverse molecular fragments. The de novo process makes use of in silico chemical
reactions to generate new compounds, and the population of compounds is
iteratively refined over a number of cycles.

In order to remove compounds with undesirable physical and chemical properties,
AutoGrow4 makes use of molecular filters such as PAINS and Lipinski rules. The
molecules from the last three generations are set up as seeds to identify
similar molecules in massive libraries.  

Required environment variables:

* :code:`RECEPTOR_PATH` - path to the original PDB file containing the protein
   pocket chosen manually by the user
* :code:`CENTER_X` - the x-coordinate center of the pocket
* :code:`CENTER_Y` - the y-coordinate of the pocket
* :code:`CENTER_Z` - the z-coordinate of the pocket
* :code:`SIZE_X` - the size of the pocket in the x direction
* :code:`SIZE_Y` - the size of the pocket in the y direction
* :code:`SIZE_Z` - the size of the pocket in the z direction

Optional environment variables:

* :code:`SOURCE_COMPOUND_FILE` - the list of compounds used to seed Autogrow4
  (default is `Fragment_MW_up_to_250.smi`, a custom version of the files found
  in Autogrow4)
* :code:`DOCKING_EXHAUSTIVENESS` - Autogrow4 exhaustiveness (default is 1)
* :code:`NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS` - the number of CPUs to use for Autogrow4
  (default is 4)
* :code:`NUMBER_OF_GENERATIONS` - the number of generations to use with
  Autogrow4 (default is 10)

Dependencies (included in Docker image):

* Autogrow4

  * Website: `<https://durrantlab.pitt.edu/autogrow4/>`_
  * Version: 4.0.3

* Autodock Vina

  * Website: `<https://vina.scripps.edu>`_
  * Version: 1.1.2

The Docker container for this stage also uses Miniconda 4.10.3 running Python
3.8 to supply a Python interpreter and various dependencies for Autogrow4, which
is in line with the recommended way to use this software.

Stage 4 - Similarity Search
---------------------------

In order to expand the candidate pool, the denovo molecules are used as seeds to
identify other similar structures in larger databases. After building 1024-bit
ECFP4 fingerprints for the denovo molecules, they are compared against molecules
in the database. The fingerprints for the database molecules are pre-generated
and are referenced with the :code:`molecule_db` parameter. The result of this
stage is a collection of molecules likely to be similar to the denovo molecules
and therefore (hopefully) likely to fit the receptor.

Required environment variables:

* :code:`SEED_LIGANDS_SMI` - a .smi file containing the ligands created in
  stage 3
* :code:`MOLECULE_DB` - the path to a molecule database to match denovo
  ligands against; the database format is described alongside the other
  :ref:`parameters <molecule_db-parameter>`

Optional environment variables:

* :code:`TANIMOTO_CUTOFF` - the minimum Tanimoto score for a match between a
  denovo ligand and a molecule in the database, molecules above this score will be
  sent on to stage 5 (default is 0.5)
* :code:`OUTPUT_PATH` - the directory to which molecule .smi files should be
  written (default is `./output`)

This stage consists entirely of custom code but relies on RDKit (specifically
the Python bindings), version 2021.9.4.

The output is one or more ``.smi`` files that contain the SMILES strings,
taken from the molecule database, thought to match the binding pocket.
Each line contains one SMILES string, then the database it came from, the
name of the molecule within that database, and the offset it was stored at
in the database (which is only for debugging purposes). The fields for each
molecule are separated by tab characters.

Stage 5 - Protein Ligand Docking
--------------------------------

For the seed-neighbor molecules identified by the similarity search, optimized
structures (lowest energy conformation generated using OpenBabel) of neighbors
are docked into their respective targets using AutoDock Vina. The number of
docking poses produced and the exhaustiveness parameter for the search for each
ligand are parameterized by the user; the default values are 9 and 4,
respectively.

The Autodock Vina seed value is set to 42 in order to facilitate reproduction.

This stage is allowed to fail since OpenBabel sometimes fails to produce a 3D
structure. These failures are ignored because there is no reasonable way to
recover and the consequences are generally insignificant.

Required environment variables:

* :code:`RECEPTOR_PDBQT` - path to the receptor (pocket) chosen by the user, in
  PDBQT format
* :code:`CENTER_X` - the x-coordinate center of the receptor
* :code:`CENTER_Y` - the y-coordinate of the receptor
* :code:`CENTER_Z` - the z-coordinate of the receptor
* :code:`SIZE_X` - the size of the receptor in the x direction
* :code:`SIZE_Y` - the size of the receptor in the y direction
* :code:`SIZE_Z` - the size of the receptor in the z direction
* :code:`LIGANDS_SMI` - a file containing the ligands (molecules) chosen for
  further processing in stage 4

Optional environment variables:

* :code:`NUMBER_OF_POSES` - the maximum number of docking poses to attempt
  using Autodock Vina

Dependencies (included in Docker image):

* Autodock Vina

  * Website: `<https://vina.scripps.edu>`_
  * Version: 1.1.2

Stage 6 - Activity Prediction
-----------------------------

The docking score produced by AutoDock Vina is only a loose estimate of the
actual binding affinity. DrugSniffer adds 3 post hoc re-scoring methods (1) the
Autodock Vina score (2) the SMINA score (3) **dock2bind** (the default) which is
a neural network re-scoring strategy. The model is trained on ligand-protein
complexes taken from the LIT-PCBA and DUD-E.

For each docked pose, 16 pose
descriptors calculated by SMINA, along with the DFIRE estimate of proteinâ€“ligand
potential are used as input to the model. **dock2bind** produces a value from
0 to 1 and can be thought of as the model's confidence that the molecule binds
to the pocket, constrained by the specific pose.

The model accepts the values below, in order, as a comma- or whitespace-delimited
table:

1. Pose (identifier)
2. gauss_1
3. gauss_2
4. repulsion
5. hydrophobic
6. non_hydrophobic
7. vdw
8. non_dir_hbond_lj
9. non_dir_anti_h_bond_quadratic
10. non_dir_h_bond
11. acceptor_acceptor_quadratic
12. donor_donor_quadratic
13. electrostatic
14. ad4_solvation
15. ligand_length
16. constant_term
17. num_tors_div
18. DFIRE

The output of this stage is a comma-delimited table of values containing the
columns listed below:

1. Pose (identifier)
2. Model output (from 0 to 1)

Required environment variables:

* :code:`RECEPTOR_PATH` - path to the original PDB file containing the protein
  receptor (pocket) chosen manually by the user
* :code:`DOCKED_PDBQT` - the docked ligand as a PDBQT file that contains all
  poses computed by Autodock Vina in stage 5

Stage 7 - ADMET Prediction (optional)
-------------------------------------

The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) of
drugs plays a key role in determining which among the potential candidate
structures are to be prioritized. The ADMET prediction here is based on molecular
fingerprint-based predictive models. While a majority of the models are binary
classification models, for some endpoints such the metabolic intrinsic
clearance, acute oral toxicity in rats, plasma protein binding and elimination
half-life, multiclass models are proposed.

For a complete list of the models
employed see `<https://doi.org/10.1186/s13321-021-00557-5>`_. For classification
models, two additional values are reported: a confidence (how certain the model
is that the prediction is a singleton) and a credibility. A confidence value of
0.95 suggests that the classifier is quite certain that the prediction is likely
to be a single label. A relatively low value of credibility suggests that the
compounds are not sufficiently represented in the training set and that the user
needs to treat the prediction with caution.

Required environment variables:

* :code:`LIGAND_SMI` - path to the ligand under evaluation

Optional environment variables:

* :code:`ADMET_CHECKS` - space-separated list of ADMET checks for FPADMET,
  values in the range ``[1, 56]`` (default is empty)
