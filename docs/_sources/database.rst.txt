Database
========

*Drug Sniffer* can be used with any collection of molecules as its database.
However, we provide two databases for users who do not wish to bring their own.
The first, an extremely small database, just a few dozen molecules, exists for
testing purposes. It can be found at ``examples/small-db``. The second is much,
much larger (about 450GB decompressed). This database is available for download
as a ZIP file from `<https://data.drugsniffer.org>`_.

Database versions, hashes, and download links can be found below.
